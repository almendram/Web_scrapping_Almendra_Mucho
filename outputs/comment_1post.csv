1n7osgn,nc8zt5x,"""Grab em by the pussy"" wasn't a big enough hint for you?

Or how about all the sexual comments about his daughter? 

Or what about looking at a ten year old and saying, ""I'm going to be dating her in ten years, can you believe it?"" 

Or walking into the dressing room at Miss Teen USA to ""inspect"" them?

Or the countless other examples?",1968

1n7osgn,nc90tyi,"Yeah I’d like to know as well, and I think we all know that it’s true.

This kind of thing goes against everything I have been taught about right and wrong. Rape is wrong, abusing children is wrong. Everything this administration is doing is wrong. So why are they succeeding? Is this a reflection of our society? Hate is being taught from one generation to the next but people won’t acknowledge it. I’m tired of seeing bad guys win. I seriously cannot believe anyone can condone such appalling behavior.",70

1n7u4w0,nca4ic6,If I had a dime...,1
1n7u4w0,nca529l,"The thing is, Donald Trump always knows he's going down. He always *believes* he's going down, and he's been that way for most of his life. He doesn't know why he succeeds; hiis inexplicable twists of fortune are as much a mystery to him as they are to everyone else. 

He's literally the evil, Bizzaro-world version of Forrest Gump: a low-IQ individual simply stumblingunwittingly through all the many major geopolitical events of his time. He makes terrible decisions and continues to strikes outrageous fortune, over and over and over again, without ever actually understanding why. 

Bullets whiz by him, career-ending scandals ding off him daily. But what I want to really reiterate is that he is *always scared shitless*. Despite appearing invulnerable to us, he always acts like a desperate, scared-shitless man.

When he does consciously attempt to take action, it's always the stupidest possible move he could choose to make, which he makes BECAUSE he's the stupidest possible person in the public stage, and it simply works, not for any reason he or any of us understand, but because he's just this dim-witted, savage, evil human being surfing on the far tail-end of some universal bell curve of outrageous luck, unaware how he got there, or why he's there, and perpetually terrified it will suddenly crash and throw him off.

Just look at him bribing Stormy Daniels in 2010s. This is a perfect example of him doing a really fucking dumb thing because he categorically misunderstands the people who support him and the forces buoying him, and doing the worst possible thing in the stupidest possible way, and getting away with it for no other reason than extraordinary luck.

People seem to think that Trump is aware of, and luxuriates in, his apparently invincibility. But it's the exact opposite. He lives in perpetual fear and paranoia. 

If he truly grasped and embraced his apparent invulnerability, he wouldn't have tried to cover up the Stormy Daniels affair. After all, as is very clear, the knowledge of that affair would probably have INCREASED his standing with his MAGA base, or at the very least, they would have been indifferent to it. 

Instead, he spent six figures and exposed himself to criminal liability to try and ""kill' the story. 

Everything he does, everything he has done for a decade and longer, is the actions of a man far out of his depths, scared and floundering as he's surrounded by dangers he doesn't comprehend, and often spared from said dangers by twists of luck and fortune that he clearly doesn't understand and never believes will save him, yet always does.

Like, if you really, truly go back and just look at his improbable life, it's honestly a little hard to even condemn him for being the way he is. 

He may be one of the luckiest human beings on the planet. He has spoiled or ruined so many fortunes, only to simply be handed another one by outrageous, insane amounts of luck. 

Everything he consciously does is the worst thing anyone could do in that situation, and it just simply keeps working. In ways no one can predict, for reasons literally no one understands, least of all him, because he's a moron.",1
1n7u4w0,nca4smv,He will surely go down this time. yeah he didn't go down all the other times. But this time it will stick. Read the article to find out how.,1
1n7u4w0,nca58w5,"We're in season 10 of the Trump Reality Show and scandal after scandal, no accountability. He was even voted in a second time! I have no doubt that he'll find a way to get out of this mess too.",1
